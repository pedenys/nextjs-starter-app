# NextJS minimalist starter

Minimalist starter template for NextJS app with TypeScript and styled-components.

## What's in the box

- NextJS 9.3
- TypeScript
- styled-components with global styles and theme
- PWA ready with `next-offline` (see `next.config.js`)
- isomorphic-unfetch for all naughty SSR/CSR things
- AppHead component to handle `<head>` config
- `.prettierrc` ready to be overwritten

## How to

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm i`
3. Follow the todo section

## Todo

- update \_document.tsx with your own favicons and meta description
- update manifest.json with your own params
- update `./public/assets/favicons` with your own favicons

## Raison d'être

NextJS is an awesome tool. It's even better when it comes with TypeScript and the usual config that is mandatory (crawl styles for SSR, custom `next/head`, etc.). Note that there's also a `.prettierrc` file for project configuration.
